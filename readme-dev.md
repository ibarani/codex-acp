This package uses the bundled `@openai/codex` dependency by default.
Set `CODEX_PATH` to run a different Codex binary; versions other than the one specified in `package.json` may not be compatible.

### Runtime environment

- `CODEX_API_KEY` - API key used when the API-key auth method is selected. Takes precedence over `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - fallback API key used when the API-key auth method is selected.
- `CODEX_PATH` - run a specific Codex executable instead of the bundled package dependency.
- `CODEX_CONFIG` - JSON object merged into the Codex session config.
- `MODEL_PROVIDER` - model provider to pass to Codex for new sessions.
- `DEFAULT_AUTH_REQUEST` - ACP auth request JSON used when Codex requires authentication.
- `INITIAL_AGENT_MODE` - initial mode id: `read-only`, `agent`, or `agent-full-access`.
- `NO_BROWSER` - hide browser-based ChatGPT auth when set.
- `APP_SERVER_LOGS` - directory for adapter logs.

Reasoning summaries follow the native Codex configuration, including an explicit
`model_reasoning_summary = "none"`. The adapter omits its per-turn summary override
unless API-key authentication or a model without reasoning requires its existing
`none` policy. Model and reasoning-effort selections remain separate.

The `backport/codex-acp-1.4` branch retains the installed adapter's 1.4.0
dependency set while repairing this configuration override. Its unmodified build
matches the installed bundle byte for byte; the current 1.11.0 source still has
the same override. Retire this backport after a current upstream adapter passes
the native runtime, authentication, tool, resume and capture acceptance boundaries.
The maintenance branch runs the same CI and PR-title checks as `main`.

Closing the ACP client's input ends the native child's input. If the child is
still running after two seconds, the adapter requests termination with SIGTERM.
Exit status or a terminating signal suppresses that fallback; a prior signal
request alone does not establish exit. The timer cannot keep an otherwise idle
adapter alive. This preserves the existing grace period and signal policy; it
does not add a SIGKILL escalation for a child that ignores SIGTERM.

### Quick start

#### Develop on Windows?

- Download and install [C++ redistributable package](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#latest-supported-redistributable-version)

#### Adjust ACP client config

Run from sources

1. Install dependencies `npm install`
2. Adjust ACP client config

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "Codex (app-server)": {
      "command": "npm",
      "args": ["run", "start", "--prefix", "/path/to/project/"],
      "env": {
        "CODEX_PATH": "node_modules/.bin/codex",
        "APP_SERVER_LOGS": "optional/path/to/existing/log/directory"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Run from binaries

1. Download a `codex-acp-<platform>.zip` archive from https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/codex-acp/releases (`<platform>` is one of: `linux`, `darwin`, `win32`)
2. Unzip the archive:
   ```bash
   unzip codex-acp-<platform>.zip
   ```
3. Adjust ACP client config

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "Codex (app-server)": {
      "command": "/path/to/codex-acp",
      "env": {
        "CODEX_PATH": "/path/to/codex"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Build binaries

Building standalone binaries requires [bun](https://bun.com/docs/installation).

Build single-file executables in `dist/bin` directory:

```bash
npm run bundle:all
```

Package binaries into zip archives:

```bash
npm run package:all
```

### Update supported Codex version

1. Update the `@openai/codex` version in `package.json` (under `dependencies`).
2. Regenerate Codex types in `src/app-server/`: `npm run generate-types`
3. Ensure there are no type errors or failed tests: `npm run typecheck` and `npm run test`
